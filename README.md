Step 1: Set Up the Environment
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. The code is written in Python and requires version 3.6 or higher.

Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

Copy code
pip install discord.py
Step 3: Create a Configuration File
Create a folder named "config" in the same directory as your Python script. Inside the "config" folder, create a file named "config.json" with the following content:


## Table of Contents
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Configuration](#configuration)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [License](#license)
- [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments)
- [Contact](#contact)
- 
Replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE with the bot token you obtained from the Discord Developer Portal. Also, replace YOUR_BOT_CREDENTIALS_HERE with any credentials you want to use in the bot (optional).

Step 4: Implement the Code
Copy the provided code into a Python file (e.g., auto_money_bot.py) and save it in the same directory as the "config" folder.

Step 5: Run the Bot
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the Python script, and run the bot using the following command:

Copy code
python auto_money_bot.py
The bot should now be up and running, sending messages to the specified channels at regular intervals, as indicated by the cooldowns in the code.
